  - '<align=left>Hey! Whitman!</align>

    <align=left>Sergeant scraping the bottom
    of the barrel today? Everyone else call in sick?</align>'
  - <align=left>Not in the mood, McLoughlin.</align>
  - <align=left>You going to fill me in or what?</align>
  - <align=left>Tell me about it. Can you believe they'd let a screw-up like me off
    his desk?</align>
  - <align=left>Take it easy, man, I'm just giving you a hard time.</align>
  - '<align=left>I''m fine, thanks for asking. Got some opportunities on the horizon,
    maybe a little mentorship with Captain Bowerman. Had a hot date the other night.</align>

    <align=left>Man,
    that desk made you boring fast. What''s it been, a couple of weeks?</align>'
  - <align=left>Come on, man. You're a good cop. It could've happened to anybody.</align>
  - <align=left>Sorry, I'm just tired of IA breathing down my neck. It's a miracle
    I got out of there with only a stress-related perceptual disturbance on my report
    card.</align>
  - <align=left>Anonymous phone call. One of the neighbors, probably. Thinks there's
    something "untoward" going on in the massage parlor.</align>
  - <align=left>Untoward? Where'd you learn such a big word?</align>
  - <align=left>No need to bullshit me, McLoughlin. I was bottom of my class at the
    academy, I was benched for six weeks for a sketchy shoot, and I've failed my
    sergeant exams twice. I'm the farthest thing from a good cop. I'm a wreck.</align>
  - <align=left>I get it. You've caught the eye of leadership and now you're testing
    the waters to see what you can get away with. I know you've been drinking with
    Captain Bowerman.</align>
  - <align=left>It's ok, I just need this case to go smoothly. Chief made it pretty
    clear that I was damn lucky to get my gun back and that I need to be very, very
    normal for the foreseeable future.</align>
  - <align=left>Good God, that's a scary thought. I hope not.</align>
  - '<align=left>Maybe you''re right. Maybe I''m just tired.</align>

    <align=left>Sorry,
    I should''ve asked: what''s up with you?</align>'
  - <align=left>It's called being professional. I've got a job to do.</align>
  - <align=left>Something like that. Frankly, I'm lucky to be back on the street
    after what happened and now I want to just move on.</align>
  - '<align=left>Six, actually. Seems like more, with IA breathing down my neck the
    whole time. And let''s face it, I was always boring.</align>

    <align=left>Anyway,
    now I just want to get back to work and forget it ever happened.</align>

    <align=left></align>'
  - <align=left>Lighten up, Whitman. After what happened, you're lucky they don't
    have you down on the sand cleaning up that whale carcass.</align>
  - <align=left>Understood, we are all business today. Remind me to tell you about
    the whale later.</align>
  - <align=left>I get that. With the festival coming up, we're going to need all
    the boots on the street we can get. Wonder if they'll be able to get rid of the
    whale in time...</align>
  - <align=left>Dude, that was the saddest thing I've ever heard. You need to get
    your shit together or Molly is going to dump you. For real.</align>
  - <align=left>Anyway, it's all in the past. Let's get you back on track. I want
    to see</align>
  - <align=left>It's going good, man. Had a good talk with Captain Bowerman. He likes
    my work, wants to get me fast-tracked.</align>
  - <align=left>Understood.</align>
  - <align=left>Well, it's good to see you off the desk. What did they end up calling
    it? Your... incident?</align>
  - <align=left>Damn, dude.</align>
  - <align=left>You wish! She's already seen me at my worst and she still said yes.
    Nowhere to go but up.</align>
  - <align=left>Third time's the charm or something.</align>
  - <align=left>Sergeant. That's great. I'm sure you'll knock it out of the park.
    Then you can tell me what I've been doing wrong.</align>
  - <align=left>Fine, I'll bite. Tell me about the whale.</align>
  - <align=left>Also, for the record, IA decided it was a stress-related perceptual
    disturbance.</align>
  - <align=left>Perceptual disturbance. Stress-related.</align>
  - <align=left>Could be worse. I talked them down from trauma-induced transient
    psychotic episode.</align>
  - <align=left>Ok. I'm going in. Stay off your phone.</align>
  - <align=left>Yeah, but your gut also thought it was a good idea to combine Don
    Quitaco's and The Rusty Chum Drum on a stakeout.</align>
  - <align=left>Ah... the Bermuda Fryangle...</align>
  - <align=left>Big old gray thing. Washed up down by the Ghost Forest a couple of
    days ago. Bones sticking out, meat and skin hanging off like rags. The tourists
    are going to love it.</align>
  - <align=left>What whale?</align>
  - <align=left>Washed up south of the Ghost Forest a couple of days ago. Smells
    like the pit of hell. Nobody knows what to do with it.</align>
  - <align=left>So what's the story here?</align>
  - <align=left>You'll get there. Fifty bucks says you pass your exams before the
    wedding. Third time's the charm, right?</align>
  - <align=left>That's the spirit.</align>
  - '<align=left>Yeah... </align>

    <align=left>You don''t know how good you''ve
    got it, Whitman. I call dibs if you get killed in the line of duty.</align>'
  - <align=left>You're not her type.</align>
  - <align=left>Jacked?</align>
  - <align=left>Illiterate.</align>
  - <align=left>Get in line.</align>
  - <align=left>Not my fault if he likes officers he can count on not to have a psychotic
    episode in the middle of a DV call.</align>
  - <align=left>You're probably right. And it looks like you'll probably make sergeant
    before me. But until then, I'm still Senior Patrol Officer. So let's keep it
    professional.</align>
  - <align=left>Damn, dude!</align>
  - <align=left>Yeah. Chief made it clear I'm still on thin ice. Need things to be
    very, very normal for a while.</align>
  - <align=left>That doesn't sound too bad. At least you're not psycho.</align>
  - <align=left>Understood.</align>
  - <align=left>Yeah. I keep telling myself that.</align>
  - <align=left>Fingers crossed this one's just a false alarm.</align>
  - <align=left>Enough talk, McLoughlin. Tell me what we're dealing with here.</align>
  - <align=left>So you were first on the scene. What can you tell me about the situation?</align>
  - <align=left>No need. The two of us have a connection. A spiritual connection.
    Ours is a love that transcends time, space, tax bracket, reading level, tastes
    in food and music...</align>
  - <align=left>I'm going in. Make sure no one goes in or out.</align>
  - <align=left>I'm going in. Watch my back.</align>
  - <align=left>They had to run the ionizer in that vehicle for three  days, McLoughlin.</align>
  - <align=left>What's your point?</align>
  - <align=left>We don't get paid to have hunches. Look at the facts, work the case.</align>
  - <align=left>Yeah, that makes sense. I did see a G-Wagon pull out of here pretty
    quick just as I rolled in. That might be something.</align>
  - <align=left>Hey, I read books. Anyway, their words not mine.</align>
  - <align=left>Lots of time to speculate later. Just stick to the facts, ok? </align>
  - <align=left>You think it's a false alarm?</align>
  - <align=left>Let's see... I saw a G-Wagon pull out of here pretty quick when I
    rolled in. Otherwise, it's been pretty quiet. Monday night at the beach, not
    a lot going on.</align>
  - <align=left>Just seems like a cliche, like something you'd see on TV. Sketchy
    Asian massage parlor? Come on, is that even a thing?</align>
  - <align=left>I'm on it.</align>
  - <align=left>No problem.</align>
  - <align=left>Yeah, yeah.</align>
  - <align=left>I'll keep it in mind. Did you go inside yet?</align>
  - <align=left>Just for a second. There's definitely a bunch of Asian ladies in
    there. They didn't seem real happy to see me.</align>
  - <align=left>Did they say why?</align>
  - '<align=left>Dispatch said something about men coming at weird hours, whatever
    that means, and how they never see the workers outside.</align>

    <align=left>What''s
    the word for someone who works at a massage place? Masseuse? Masseur? Massager?</align>'
  - <align=left>Massage therapist?</align>
  - '<align=left>That doesn''t sound right.</align>

    <align=left>Anyway, my gut
    tells me it''s just some paranoid middle-aged white lady who watches too much
    SVU.</align>'
  - <align=left>Welcome in! Is this your first time?</align>
  - <align=left>Officer Whitman, Skookum City Police. Good morning.</align>
  - <align=left>Hello, Officer. What can I do for you? Is it the neck? You look like
    you carry stress in your neck. Maybe your jaw.</align>
  - <align=left>This will be a lot easier if you don't play games with me, ok? I
    have some questions for you.</align>
  - <align=left>We're here to talk about you.</align>
  - <align=left>No, thank you, I'm fine. I would like to hear about you, though.</align>
  - <align=left>Me? What do you want to know?</align>
  - <align=left>It's ok, Officer, you're just doing your job.</align>
  - <align=left>Not here. Doing laundry.</align>
  - <align=left>Yes, from one of my regular clients.</align>
  - <align=left>Don't play dumb. What's going on in here?</align>
  - <align=left>We've had some complaints about this place. Just </align>
  - <align=left>Do you like working here?</align>
  - <align=left>I assume you have a license or something?</align>
  - <align=left>Of course he is. And I assume you have no idea when he'll be back,
    if ever?</align>
  - <align=left>When will he be back?</align>
  - <align=left>Miss. He's not here. It's safe to tell me the truth. Is he making
    you do this?</align>
  - <align=left>Miss, this is clearly not a normal massage parlor! Tell me the truth.</align>
  - <align=left>Is that normal?</align>
  - <align=left>Very generous.</align>
  - <align=left>It's a massage parlor. We give massages.</align>
  - <align=left>That's all?</align>
  - <align=left>Best job I ever had.</align>
  - <align=left>Don't I look ok? </align>
  - <align=left>What did you have in mind?</align>
  - <align=left>You see anything wrong?</align>
  - <align=left>Not really. So... your clients don't try to... take advantage of
    you?</align>
  - <align=left>Your clients never try to take advantage of you?</align>
  - <align=left>Take advantage? What is this? 1800s? No, no, nothing like that. This
    is a good business.</align>
  - <align=left>Massages. Hard, soft, neck, back. Feet.</align>
  - <align=left>That's all? Your clients never try to take advantage of you?</align>
  - <align=left>Sorry, I have to ask.</align>
  - <align=left>Officer, it might not look like it, but I have had a very hard life.
    I have nothing to complain about here. And I have no reason to leave.</align>
  - <align=left>License?</align>
  - <align=left>To work as a massage therapist... or whatever you call yourself.</align>
  - <align=left>Oh, of course.</align>
  - <align=left>I'd like to see it, please.</align>
  - <align=left>I'm sorry, our manager keeps all those things.</align>
  - <align=left>Go get your massage therapist's license right now, or I will have
    this place shut down by end of day tomorrow.</align>
  - <align=left>I have trouble believing that.</align>
  - <align=left>Do you realize how improbable that sounds?</align>
  - <align=left>I can't, they're all locked up in our manager's office at the back.
    To keep them safe.</align>
  - <align=left>To keep them safe? Or keep you working here against your will?</align>
  - <align=left>Is that not normal?</align>
  - <align=left>Sorry, Officer, it's the way it is. Manager keeps them locked up
    in his office for safety.</align>
  - <align=left>It's your license. It belongs to you.</align>
  - <align=left>What if you want to leave?</align>
  - <align=left>Why would I want to leave?</align>
  - <align=left>I don't need it. Anyway, I trust our him. We're very close. He takes
    good care of me.</align>
  - <align=left>Fine. Just get me your manager, then.</align>
  - <align=left>Sorry. He is the manager, not me.</align>
  - <align=left>He didn't tell me. Laundry can take a very long time.</align>
  - <align=left>No one is making me do this! I like my job. They pay me well, I am
    safe, I have a place to sleep. I don't need anybody to save me.</align>
  - <align=left>That's enough, Jasmine. You can go.</align>
  - <align=left>Those your things?</align>
  - <align=left>I'm very good.</align>
  - <align=left>I've only ever worked here.</align>
  - <align=left>At least give me your manager's name.</align>
  - <align=left>John? Johnny? Something like that.</align>
  - <align=left>Last name?</align>
  - <align=left>No last names here. Very friendly, very informal.</align>
  - <align=left>You clearly have not had my massage.</align>
  - <align=left>Have a lovely day, Officer.</align>
