  - 'Dialogue: Officer Mitch McLoughlin'
  - Lily
  - Jasmine
  - Lily II
  - Untitled dialogue
  - Lieutenant Chen
  - 'Hey! Whitman!

    

    Sergeant scraping the bottom of the barrel today?
    Everyone else call in sick?'
  - Not in the mood, McLoughlin.
  - You going to fill me in or what?
  - Tell me about it. Can you believe they'd let a screw-up like me off his desk?
  - Take it easy, man, I'm just giving you a hard time.
  - 'I''m fine, thanks for asking. Got some opportunities on the horizon, maybe a
    little mentorship with Captain Bowerman. Had a hot date the other night.

    

    Man,
    that desk made you boring fast. What''s it been, a couple of weeks?'
  - Come on, man. You're a good cop. It could've happened to anybody.
  - Sorry, I'm just tired of IA breathing down my neck. It's a miracle I got out
    of there with only a stress-related perceptual disturbance on my report card.
  - Anonymous phone call. One of the neighbors, probably. Thinks there's something
    "untoward" going on in the massage parlor.
  - Untoward? Where'd you learn such a big word?
  - No need to bullshit me, McLoughlin. I was bottom of my class at the academy,
    I was benched for six weeks for a sketchy shoot, and I've failed my sergeant
    exams twice. I'm the farthest thing from a good cop. I'm a wreck.
  - I get it. You've caught the eye of leadership and now you're testing the waters
    to see what you can get away with. I know you've been drinking with Captain Bowerman.
  - It's ok, I just need this case to go smoothly. Chief made it pretty clear that
    I was damn lucky to get my gun back and that I need to be very, very normal for
    the foreseeable future.
  - Good God, that's a scary thought. I hope not.
  - 'Maybe you''re right. Maybe I''m just tired.

    

    Sorry, I should''ve
    asked: what''s up with you?'
  - It's called being professional. I've got a job to do.
  - Something like that. Frankly, I'm lucky to be back on the street after what happened
    and now I want to just move on.
  - 'Six, actually. Seems like more, with IA breathing down my neck the whole time.
    And let''s face it, I was always boring.

    

    Anyway, now I just want
    to get back to work and forget it ever happened.'
  - Lighten up, Whitman. After what happened, you're lucky they don't have you down
    on the sand cleaning up that whale carcass.
  - Understood, we are all business today. Remind me to tell you about the whale
    later.
  - I get that. With the festival coming up, we're going to need all the boots on
    the street we can get. Wonder if they'll be able to get rid of the whale in time...
  - Dude, that was the saddest thing I've ever heard. You need to get your shit together
    or Molly is going to dump you. For real.
  - Anyway, it's all in the past. Let's get you back on track. I want to see
  - It's going good, man. Had a good talk with Captain Bowerman. He likes my work,
    wants to get me fast-tracked.
  - Understood.
  - Well, it's good to see you off the desk. What did they end up calling it? Your...
    incident?
  - Damn, dude.
  - You wish! She's already seen me at my worst and she still said yes. Nowhere to
    go but up.
  - Third time's the charm. Or something.
  - Sergeant. That's great. I'm sure you'll knock it out of the park. Then you can
    tell me what I've been doing wrong.
  - Fine, I'll bite. Tell me about the whale.
  - And, for the record, IA decided it was a stress-related perceptual disturbance.
  - Perceptual disturbance. Stress-related.
  - Could be worse. I talked them down from trauma-induced transient psychotic episode.
  - Ok. I'm going in. Stay off your phone.
  - Yeah, but your gut also thought it was a good idea to combine Don Quitaco's and
    The Rusty Chum Drum on a stakeout.
  - Ah... the Bermuda Fryangle...
  - Big old gray thing. Washed up down by the Ghost Forest a couple of days ago.
    Bones sticking out, meat and skin hanging off like rags. The tourists are going
    to love it.
  - What whale?
  - Washed up south of the Ghost Forest a couple of days ago. Smells like the pit
    of hell. Nobody knows what to do with it.
  - So what's the story here?
  - You'll get there. Fifty bucks says you pass your exams before the wedding. Third
    time's the charm, right?
  - That's the spirit.
  - "Yeah... \r\n\r\nYou don't know how good you've got it, Whitman. I call dibs
    if you get killed in the line of duty."
  - You're not her type.
  - Jacked?
  - Illiterate.
  - Get in line.
  - Not my fault if he likes officers he can count on not to have a psychotic episode
    in the middle of a DV call.
  - You're probably right. And it looks like you'll probably make sergeant before
    me. But until then, I'm still Senior Patrol Officer. So let's keep it professional.
  - Damn, dude!
  - Yeah. Chief made it clear I'm still on thin ice. Need things to be very, very
    normal for a while.
  - That doesn't sound too bad. At least you're not psycho.
  - Understood.
  - Yeah. I keep telling myself that.
  - It's good to have you back.
  - Fingers crossed this one's just a false alarm.
  - Enough talk, McLoughlin. Tell me what we're dealing with here.
  - So you were first on the scene. What can you tell me about the situation?
  - No need. The two of us have a connection. A spiritual connection. Ours is a love
    that transcends time, space, tax bracket, reading level, tastes in food and music...
  - I'm going in. Make sure no one goes in or out.
  - I'm going in. Watch my back.
  - They had to run the ionizer in that vehicle for three days, McLoughlin.
  - What's your point?
  - We don't get paid to have hunches. Look at the facts, work the case.
  - Yeah, that makes sense. I did see a G-Wagon pull out of here pretty quick just
    as I rolled in. That might be something.
  - Hey, I read books. Anyway, their words not mine.
  - Lots of time to speculate later. Just stick to the facts, ok?
  - You think it's a false alarm?
  - Let's see... I saw a G-Wagon pull out of here pretty quick when I rolled in.
    Otherwise, it's been pretty quiet. Monday night at the beach, not a lot going
    on.
  - Just seems like a cliche, like something you'd see on TV. Sketchy Asian massage
    parlor? Come on, is that even a thing?
  - I'm on it.
  - No problem.
  - Yeah, yeah.
  - I'll keep it in mind. Did you go inside yet?
  - Just for a second. There's definitely a bunch of Asian ladies in there. They
    didn't seem real happy to see me.
  - Did they say why they thought that?
  - 'Dispatch said something about men coming at weird hours, whatever that means,
    and how they never see the workers outside.

    

    What''s the word for
    someone who works at a massage place? Masseuse? Masseur? Massager?'
  - Massage therapist?
  - 'That doesn''t sound right.

    

    Anyway, my gut tells me it''s just some
    paranoid middle-aged white lady who watches too much SVU.'
  - You ok, Whitman?
  - Dizzy spell. Vertigo or something. I'm fine.
  - So, was I right?
  - About what?
  - 'I''m fine. Just felt weird in there. Essential oils or something.

    

    Keep
    this between us, ok? I don''t want the Chief getting the wrong idea.'
  - I think so. What about you? Did you feel anything weird just now?
  - Nothing. Quiet as the grave.
  - Weird.
  - Ok. No problem.
  - My hunch.
  - I don't know. There's definitely something weird going on in there.
  - Too soon to tell. Got any other suggestions?
  - 'You don''t have a sixth sense, McLoughlin! None of us do.

    

    Now,
    have you seen anything useful out here or not?'
  - Most of these places are closed down for the day, but there's a pawn shop and
    a convenience store still open. Maybe check with whoever's running the registers?
  - Worth a shot. Let's see what they know.
  - Well? She answered your questions. Was there something else?
  - 'Lily raises her eyebrows skeptically.

    

'
  - Underneath, Lily feels tired, world weary, beaten down, trapped. On the surface,
    she's just kind of annoyed with Whitman right now.
  - She leans up against the wall just inside the door, crosses her arms, and waits
    a moment before speaking.
  - I need the truth, Lily.
  - I want to see the two characters in relation to each other in the space while
    the player makes this dialogue decision. Lily on the left side of the frame,
    Whitman on the right.
  - In the brief silence, it might be good to hear some faint laughter from somewhere
    else in the massage parlor, suggesting that there are other ladies here.
  - Whitman and Lily are sizing each other up. Whitman's frustration is growing and
    he thinks for a moment while trying to figure out a different angle.
  - Whitman probably runs his hands through his hair in frustration or rubs his temples
    or something similar.
  - Long pause while Whitman chooses his next words.
  - You've already heard it. We are all very happy here and we do not need your help.
  - All business, very firm.
  - Standing up straight, her back off the wall now.
  - I need you all to stop lying to me.
  - I want to see the two characters in relation to each other in the space while
    the player makes this dialogue decision. Lily on the left side of the frame,
    Whitman on the right.

  - Long pause while Whitman chooses his next words.
  - I'm sorry, that does not happen at a normal massage place.
  - Gesturing to the southwest corner of the room, where Jasmine's gifts are piled
    up.
  - Whitman stands back and watches as Lily heads for the door.
  - 
  - Whitman steps in between Lily and the door, maybe puts out a hand to slow her
    down.
  - Whitman takes a seat on the stool by the bed and crosses his arms. No pressure,
    no rush.
  - You in charge here?
  - Firm but not angry. Trying to take a strong tone with her right out of the gate
    to make it clear who's in charge and hopefully get her to be more forthright
    throughout rest of conversation.
  - Curious. Studying her. Lily is a new opportunity to get information about this
    place. Maybe she'll be more helpful than Jasmine was.
  - 
  - And you are?
  - All business. Straight to the point.
  - Curious. Studying her. Lily is a new opportunity to get information about this
    place. Maybe she'll be more helpful than Jasmine was.
  - I'm Officer Whitman. What's your name?
  - Gentle, sympathetic, trying to put her at ease as much as possible.
  - Curious. Studying her. Lily is a new opportunity to get information about this
    place. Maybe she'll be more helpful than Jasmine was.
  - Lily.
  - Lily's close up should be a profile shot at this point in the conversation, probably
    from her right side, maybe with the wall art over the bed in the background.
    I want her to feel closed off, not open, half of her self hidden, evoking the
    sense of all that she's keeping secret. A straight on close up will feel too
    open and honest at this stage, I think.
  - For a moment, it almost looks like she's going to say something else. Sadness
    and regret passes over her face.
  - Brief pause before the line, like she has to think about it for a second.
  - Not even close.
  - Lily's close up should be a profile shot at this point in the conversation, probably

    open and honest at this stage, I think.
  - Lily laughs bitterly and shakes her head.
  - What do you do here?
  - Stay on Lily.
  - 'Whitman is making an effort to sound conversational, relaxed.

    

    Lily
    softens slightly in response. Not quite so rigid.'
  - Maybe she shifts against the wall and lets her shoulder sag a little bit.
  - Unhurried. Maybe a little pause before Whitman's line.
  - Same as everybody else. But I've been here the longest, so I try to look after
    the other girls. Help them settle in.
  - She looks away and shrugs for a moment before answering.
  - She looks away and shrugs for a moment before answering.
  - Slight pause before the line.
  - Lily.

  - I said, did you need something else?
  - Renewed calm and determination. Looking Whitman straight in the eye. Challenging
    him a bit.
  - She's starting to get fed up with this guy. Less tired, a little more determined
    and defensive now.
  - Maybe hands on hips now, at least her left hand. Right hand starting to tap her
    leg in slowly growing impatience.
  - No pause after her previous line. Should flow right into this one.
  - Are you in charge?
  - Stay on Lily.
  - I just work here.
  - Gentle shake of the head.
  - Then why did Jasmine listen to you?
  - Quick cut back to Whitman.
  - Challenging her, trying to get the truth from her.
  - Right on the heels of Lily's line, almost no pause.
  - Because you were harassing her and she wanted out. We take care of each other
    here.
  - And cut back to Lily just as quick.
  - Whitman's confrontational tone sparks flash of annoyance in Lily. She's got some
    spirit left, even if it's hidden pretty deep. The moment is brief, though. By
    the time she says "We take care of each other here", she just sounds tired again.
  - Gestures at Whitman in annoyance on "you were harassing her".
  - She comes right back at him pretty quickly. Then pauses before she says "We take
    care of each other..."
  - What's your name?
  - 
  - Quick thoughtful frown from Whitman. That didn't work the way he wanted it to.
    He looks down for a moment, then tries another tack.
  - 
  - Pause before line as Whitman gathers his thoughts.
  - Lily.
  - Oh, I see. Cute Asian girls at a massage parlor must be prostitutes.
  - Annoyed, defensive, sarcasm. Whitman is hitting close to home and she needs to
    throw him off.
  - I think Lily probably stands up straight now, her back off the wall, gesturing
    angrily with both hands.
  - 'I have nothing more to say. This place is exactly what it appears to be: a normal
    massage parlor.'
  - She hesitates, then takes a quick, fearful glance around the room, maybe at the
    ceiling or the far upper corners, like they might be hiding cameras.
  - 
  - Hesitation before she speaks.
  - Then explain all of that!
  - Gesturing to the southwest corner of the room, where Jasmine's gifts are piled
    up.
  - She's very good. He comes back every week.
  - Lily pauses, thinks, then shrugs. She dismisses your observation almost flippantly.
  - Lily pauses, thinks, then shrugs.
  - Shrug first, then line.
  - Doesn't all of that bother you at all?
  - Trying to coax a response out of her.
  - Gesturing to the southwest corner of the room, where Jasmine's gifts are piled
    up.
  - Why should it? Sometimes clients tip big. Sometimes they think they are in love
    with you. It happens to all of us.
  - A grimace crosses Lily's face before she can stop herself. She shrugs, but it
    clearly does bother her.
  - A grimace crosses Lily's face before she can stop herself. She shrugs, but it
    clearly does bother her.
  - Shrug first, then line.
  - Do you go to a lot of massage parlors, Officer? Sometimes clients tip. Sometimes
    they tip big.
  - Lily pointedly does not look at the gifts. Not impressed with your observation.
  - Comes right back at Whitman. Not rattled or daunted at all.
  - Isn't this the Spiritwood logo?
  - Switch to second set of camera set ups.
  - His attention stays on the gifts, I think. Doesn't look up yet.
  - Thinking hard, trying to figure out how to get the information he needs out of
    Lily. This is a real challenge for him.
  - 'Whitman is bent over (or crouching or kneeling or something), studying one of
    the gifts. '
  - I want his name.
  - I think the anger here is heartfelt, but directed at the client, not Lily. He's
    not trying to intimidate her as a tactic; he genuinely hates men who hurt women
    in this way. He's trying to keep it under control, but it still comes through
    in his face and his voice.
  - I suspect Whitman's baseline is moving towards a low level simmering anger at
    those who did this to Lily and Jasmine.
  - Whitman stands up before he speaks. Maybe a clenched fist by his side as he tries
    to keep his anger under control.
  - Pause as Whitman stands up before speaking.
  - What can you tell me about him?
  - Keeping his anger under better control here.
  - I suspect Whitman's baseline is moving towards a low level simmering anger at
    those who did this to Lily and Jasmine.
  - Whitman stands up and turns to face Lily.
  - Pause while he stands up and turns to face Lily.
  - You have any clients like that?
  - I'd like to see anger on his face for a moment before he masters himself and
    calms down enough to speak gently. Probably a shake of the head as he tries to
    get his feelings under control. When he does speak, though, it is calm.
  - I suspect Whitman's baseline is moving towards a low level simmering anger at
    those who trafficked Lily and Jasmine.
  - Whitman stands up, but has trouble looking straight at Lily because he's pretty
    upset about this situation. A fist clenched by his side, possibly.
  - Longer pause here. Whitman stands up and then needs a moment to get his anger
    under control before he can speak gently to Lily.
  - I guess so. That client always comes with vouchers from the casino.
  - Again, this is a new wide shot.
  - Lily is careful to remain non-committal.
  - Getting bored.
  - She turns to watch Whitman.
  - What, throwing shiny toys at everybody and driving around in a car that sounds
    like it's going sixty when it's going twenty-five in the parking lot? Those types
    prefer Jasmine. Fine by me.
  - Jasmine snorts in derision before answering. This is the closest she's gotten
    to a smile. Maybe just a smirk. She actually finds this a little bit funny, in
    a pathetic way.
  - Always comes at the same time. I know when he's here because his stupid car always
    shakes the windows.
  - Maybe her eyes drift up and away and her head tilts for just moment as she thinks
    if there's anything she can safely tell Whitman.
  - Pause as Lily thinks for a second before answering.
  - You have a warrant?
  - Lily is not impressed.
  - Can we wrap this up? I'm very tired and I've still got a few things to do before
    my shift is over.
  - 'Lily suddenly looks more tired than ever. '
  - Whatever Lily was feeling before is replaced by a baseline of utter weariness.
  - As her body language sags, she goes to sit on the edge of the bed.
  - She goes to sit on the edge of the bed before she speaks.
  - You ever sleep here?
  - Whitman is speaking, but the camera is on Lily.
  - Lily watches Whitman pace. Maybe she looks away in boredom for a moment right
    before he speaks.
  - 
  - Pause before Whitman speaks.
  - What do you know about people living here, in the building?
  - Even though Whitman speaks in this shot, the camera is on Lily.
  - Lily watches Whitman pace. Maybe she looks away in boredom for a moment right
    before he speaks.
  - 
  - Pause as Whitman paces back and forth before speaking.
  - Do you have a safe place to stay?
  - Whitman is speaking, but camera is on Lily.
  - Lily watches Whitman pace. Maybe she looks away in boredom for a moment right
    before he speaks.
  - 
  - Pause as Whitman paces before speaking.
  - Once in a while, maybe, if I have to stay very late or start very early.
  - Camera stays on Lily.
  - Lily shrugs.
  - I'm... staying with a friend right now. Getting my own place soon, though.
  - Camera stays on Lily, but moves in for a close up. Close up should be somewhere
    between profile and 3/4. She's opening up slightly, a little less closed off,
    but still not fully open.
  - Some hesitation. She's treading on dangerous ground here, has to be careful what
    she says.
  - That sounds like one of our crazy neighbors talking. They are all jealous because
    we do good business. They come and go, but we've been here seven years now. There's
    nine of us, all busy, all the time.
  - Camera still on Lily, then cuts to Whitman on "There's nine of us..."
  - A short, derisive laugh before she speaks.
  - Whitman has stopped pacing to listen.
  - And what about the other ladies?
  - Whitman pauses in his pacing.
  - I'm not the manager, how should I know?
  - Camera stays on Whitman through Lily's dialogue.
  - Whitman frowns at Lily's answer, starts pacing again.
  - Since it's an over the shoulder shot, we can see Lily shrug as she responds.
  - And what about the other ladies?
  - Whitman pauses in his pacing.
  - They take very good care of us here, ok? We have everything we need.
  - Camera retreats, she's more closed off again.
  - She looks down or away. Flash of frustration crosses her face. Annoyed with herself
    for opening up slightly.
  - Leans back a little, crosses her arm. On the defensive.
  - Pause before speaking. Emotions play across her face first.
  - How many other, uh, therapists work here?
  - Whitman paces a few more steps before pausing to speak again.
  - Pause before line.
  - How many of you are there?
  - Whitman is trying to push the momentary advantage he had, but we can tell that
    the moment has passed and it's slipping away. This conversation is all but over.
  - Nine, right now, I think.
  - Lily has checked out of this conversation and is looking for an exit ramp.
  - Nine, right now. They come and go. A few every year.
  - Well, you're clearly grasping at straws now, so I'm going to go. Please don't
    bother us again.
  - Lily is done. What a waste of time.
  - Lily puts her hands on the bed to get ready to rise, then actually rises on "Please
    don't bother us again."
  - A half-second pause as Lily waits to see if Whitman has anything better to say.
  - Look, I'm going to go. I'm sure you've got more important things to do. I trust
    you can find your way out.
  - Lily rises to go during the last sentence of the line.
  - Listen, I really have to go now. Don't worry about us.
  - Lily is trying to put this as kindly as possible, but she really wants out of
    this conversation.
  - Lily gets ready to stand, maybe puts her hands on the bed or on her knees like
    she's getting ready to push herself up, then actually stands on "Don't worry
    about us".
  - What do you think you're doing?
  - Really annoyed by this.
  - She bats Whitman's hand aside.
  - Lily, you don't have to do this.
  - Whitman takes a step back and raises his hands about chest height, palms out,
    in a placating gesture, as if to say "Take it easy, I'm not going to hurt you".
  - Get out of my way.
  - Pretty angry.
  - Does your family know where you are?
  - Whitman is flailing now. He's lost control of this situation and is just throwing
    everything at the wall to see if something sticks.
  - Still backing up slowly? Maybe takes another step back as Lily presses forward?
  - My family couldn't care less. Now move.
  - Angry, bitter, hard.
  - Without hesitation, copmletely confident in the truth of this statement.
  - You're not a very good cop, are you?
  - She gives Whitman a funny look. A mixture of surprise, pity, and disdain.
  - After she stands, Lily pauses and turns to look at Whitman.
  - Does your family know where you are?
  - New angle on the characters, since they've both changed positions.
  - Relaxed, conversational. Whitman is taking a very hands-off approach here.
  - They couldn't care less about me.
  - 'This brings up painful memories for Lily. '
  - She's still turned half toward the door. Wants to leave, but something is holding
    her back. After her line, she takes another half step toward the door.
  - It's a second before she can answer.
  - I promise you that's not true. What did you do before this?
  - Stay on Lily for the first sentence so we can see her reaction. Then cut over
    to Whitman on "What did you..."
  - 'Lily''s face hardens when Whitman answers, putting up emotional walls.

    

    Whitman
    is heartfelt, sad. He''s almost given up here. This is such a sad situation and
    it seems like there''s nothing he can do.'
  - 'Lily hovers on edge of indecision.

    

    I''m thinking Whitman''s hands
    are hanging down loosely between his legs. He feels pretty helpless. Maybe he
    looks down at the floor and shakes his head slightly in between sentences.'
  - First sentence comes hard on the heels of the previous. Whitman is thinking about
    his words, it just comes right out of his heart. Then pause and he thinks about
    what to say next.
  - And what about the families of the other girls here?
  - Calling after Lily as she sweeps from the room.
  - My family is better off without me.
  - A flash of resentment and anger passes over Lily's face. She lashes out.
  - ' As soon as the words are out, Lily turns and leaves the room in a rush.'
  - You don't have to do this, Lily.
  - 'The world starts to tilt and blur as Insight kicks in.

    

    Cut to Whitman''s
    consternation.'
  - Whitman's expression in the close up is "Crap, not again".
  - 
  - School. For nursing.
  - Lily doesn't know why she's continuing to talk to this guy.
  - You could do that again.
  - Whitman's eyes are pleading with her. This is his last ditch effort.
  - Maybe a very slow push in on Lily while you choose your next words.
  - Lily is probably defaulting to growing impatience now. She just wants to get
    this over with as quickly as possible.
  - Insert of Jasmine's gifts piled in the corner.
  - Insert of Jasmine's gifts piled in the corner.
  - Insert of Jasmine's gifts piled in the corner.
  - New angle on the scene.
  - Whitman crosses to examine Jasmine's gifts up close. Maybe he bends over to study
    one of the handbags or a bottle of perfume. Not sure if it's practical for him
    to pick something up.
  - Thinking hard. He knows he's running out of chances with Lily.
  - Whitman starts to pace, thinking hard about what to say next.
  - Camera starts wide, on both characters, then cuts to Whitman as he decides what
    to do.
  - Lily turns and starts to walk away.
  - 'The thoughts going through Lily''s head are something like: "What is this guy
    doing? What kind of cop is this?"'
  - Lily pauses by the door and looks back at Whitman funny.
  - 
  - 'As Lily pushes past Whitman, the world starts to tilt and blur.

    

    Cut
    to close up of Whitman''s consternation.

    

    Cut to next shot just as
    he turns to look at Lily.'
  - Lily pushes past Whitman and heads for the door. Whitman grows disoriented, starts
    to lose his balance, puts out his hands to steady himself. He turns to look at
    Lily.
  - Go home, Officer. You don't know what you're dealing with.
  - 'Camera low to the ground, I think, so that the frame is dominated by the shadows
    Lily is casting back toward Whitman.

    

    When she pauses in the doorway,
    she is silhouetted against the light beyond.'
  - 'Lily is walking towards the door, casting two shadows back across the floor
    toward Whitman.

    

    One shadow is clearly hers.

    

    The other
    shadow is definitely not hers. It is the shadow of a man wearing a crown of crooked
    sticks and a heavy shroud around his shoulders. He holds a bundle of keys in
    one hand and a coil of rope in the other.

    

    Lily pauses in the door
    and looks back over her shoulder.'
  - 'The world tilts and blurs further as Whitman loses his balance and stumbles
    to the ground.

    

    Cut to Inisght camera again, as Lily leaves the room,
    followed by her two shadows.'
  - Go home, Officer. You don't know what you're dealing with.
  - 'Lily is walking towards the door, casting two shadows back across the floor
    toward Whitman.

    

    One shadow is hers.

    

    The other shadow
    is definitely not hers. It is the shadow of a man wearing a crown of crooked
    sticks and a heavy shroud around his shoulders. He holds a bundle of keys in

    Lily pauses in the doorway
    and looks back at you over her shoulder.'
  - 'The world tilts and blurs further as Whitman loses his balance and stumbles
    to the ground.

    

    Cut to Inisght camera again, as Lily leaves the room,
    followed by her two shadows.'
  - Go home, Officer. We're not worth your time.
  - Camera low to the ground, I think, so that the frame is dominated by the shadows
    Lily is casting back toward Whitman.
  - 'Lily is standing in the doorway, casting two shadows back across the floor toward
    Whitman.

    

    One shadow is clearly hers.

    is definitely not hers. It is the shadow of a man wearing a crown of crooked
    sticks and a heavy shroud around his shoulders. He holds a bundle of keys in
    one hand and a coil of rope in the other.'
  - 'Wide shot, probably, as Lily reappears in the doorway.

    

    Then quick
    cut to Whitman''s close up as world starts to tilt and blur around him. Insight
    is kicking in.'
  - 'Lily slowly steps back into the doorway.

    

    Whitman loses his balance
    as Insight kicks in.'
  - Hello, Officer. What can I do for you? Is it the neck? You look like you carry
    stress in your neck. Maybe your jaw.
  - This will be a lot easier if you don't play games with me, ok? I have some questions
    for you.
  - We're here to talk about you.
  - No, thank you, I'm fine. I would like to hear about you, though.
  - Me? What do you want to know?
  - It's ok, Officer, you're just doing your job.
  - Not here. Doing laundry.
  - Yes, from one of my regular clients.
  - Don't play dumb. What's going on in here?
  - We've had some complaints about this place. Just
  - Do you like working here?
  - I assume you have a license or something?
  - Of course he is. And I assume you have no idea when he'll be back, if ever?
  - When will he be back?
  - Miss. He's not here. It's safe to tell me the truth. Is he making you do this?
  - Miss, this is clearly not a normal massage parlor! Tell me the truth.
  - Is that normal?
  - Very generous.
  - It's a massage parlor. We give massages.
  - That's all?
  - Best job I ever had.
  - Don't I look ok?
  - What did you have in mind?
  - You see anything wrong?
  - Not really. So... your clients don't try to... take advantage of you?
  - Your clients never ask for anything... extra? Nebver try to take advantage of
    you?
  - Take advantage? What is this? 1800s? No, no, nothing like that. This is a good
    business.
  - What do you do?
  - Massages. Hard, soft, neck, back. Feet.
  - That's all? Your clients never try to take advantage of you?
  - Sorry, I have to ask.
  - Officer, it might not look like it, but I have had a very hard life. I have nothing
    to complain about here. And I have no reason to leave.
  - License?
  - For your work as a massage therapist... or whatever you call yourself.
  - Oh, of course.
  - I'd like to see it, please.
  - I'm sorry, our manager keeps all those things.
  - Go get your massage therapist's license right now, or I will have this place
    shut down by end of day tomorrow.
  - I have trouble believing that.
  - Do you realize how improbable that sounds?
  - I can't, they're all locked up in our manager's office at the back. To keep them
    safe.
  - To keep them safe? Or to keep you working here against your will?
  - Is that not normal?
  - Sorry, Officer, it's the way it is. Manager keeps them locked up in his office
    for safety.
  - It's your license. It belongs to you.
  - What if you want to leave?
  - Why would I want to leave?
  - I don't need it. Anyway, I trust our him. We're very close. He takes good care
    of me.
  - Fine. Just get me your manager, then.
  - Sorry. He is the manager, not me.
  - He didn't tell me. Laundry can take a very long time.
  - No one is making me do this! I like my job. They pay me well, I am safe, I have
    a place to sleep. I don't need anybody to save me.
  - That's enough, Jasmine. You can go.
  - Those your things?
  - I'm very good.
  - I've only ever worked here.
  - At least give me your manager's name.
  - John? Johnny? Something like that.
  - Last name?
  - No last names here. Very friendly, very informal.
  - You clearly have not had my massage.
  - Have a lovely day, Officer.
  - 
  - Camera on door.
  - 'Offscreen, before he enters, we hear Whitman call: "Lily?"'
  - Whitman steps in, scanning the room.
  - 
  - Still on Lily's back. Again, camera is probably lower to the ground so that the
    focus is on the extra shadow she is now casting.
  - 'Lily does not turn. Still peering into the mirror paying Whitman absolutely
    no attention.

    

    But now she''s casting that strange second shadow
    again: crooked crown, ring of antique keys, coil of rope.'
  - Lily is curled up on the bed scrolling on her phone, face lit up by whatever
    app she's on. She looks up when Whitman enters and rolls her eyes, tossing the
    phone aside.
  - Lily is curled up on the bed scrolling on her phone, face lit up by whatever
    app she's on. She looks up when Whitman enters and rolls her eyes, tossing the
    phone aside.
  - Where is everybody? It looks closed.
  - Whitman steps a few feet into the room and looks around.
  - We ARE closed. Thanks to you guys. What do you want now?
  - Lily slides off the bed and crosses to the sink, where she checks her makeup
    in the mirror, more out of boredom than anything else.
  - Just a couple more questions.
  - Business-like, professional.
  - Haven't you already made our lives hard enough?
  - Lily couldn't be less interested. Not engaging with Whitman at all.
  - Lily's back is still to us. She peers closer into the mirror, inspecting her
    lipstick or something on her cheek or whatever.
  - I wanted to give you one more chance.
  - Direct. Not angry, just tough love. No time to mess around.
  - I need your help, Lily.
  - Vulnerable. Almost begging. Looks down at first, then looks up and speaks.
  - The room starts to tilt around Whitman.
  - Whitman isn't scared this time. He knows exactly what's happening and he is determined
    not to let it get the better of him this time. Using every ounce of concentration
    and will to keep himself on his feet, forcing himself to focus.
  - Whitman grabs the doorframe or something and holds himself up by sheer force
    of will.
  - Probably pushing in even closer and closer on Whitman's face as this moment unfolds...
  - Probably the sound grows muddled along with the visuals. Voices from Lily's past?
    As Whitman focuses, the sound starts to clear...
  - Whitman grimaces, trying to listen to the shadow like Chen taught him.
  - Whitman is holding onto the doorframe for dear life.
  - '"...they will never take you back, not after what you have done. Madeline is
    dead. You are Lily and you are mine."'
  - Back on the shadow. Focus even closer on the shadow now if possible.
  - '...and then the muddy sound snaps into focus and we hear the shadow''s line:

    

    "...they
    will never take you back, not after what you have done. Madeline is dead. You
    are Lily and you are mine."'
  - Who is he?
  - Whitman looms a little larger over Lily's shoulder. Not close enough to be actually
    threatening.
  - Straight to the point, but not unkind. Whitman watches Lily's face closely for
    any reaction.
  - Whitman walks closer, closing the distance between him and Lily.
  - Whitman doesn't speak until he stops moving.
  - Tell me what happened. What's his name?
  - Whitman looms a little larger over Lily as he gets closer. He comes close enough
    to be almost threatening, at least putting pressure on her.
  - Whitman watches Lily closely.
  - Whitman walks a little closer to Lily, closing the distance between them.
  - Wait until Whitman stops walking and reaches new position before he speaks.
  - It doesn't matter what he made you do. You don't belong to him.
  - Whitman approaches a bit, but still keeps some distance. Non-threatening, indirect.
  - Whitman considers his words, tries to find the kindest possible way to phrase
    this.
  - Whitman takes a few slow steps towards Lily, but at bit of an angle, a tangent,
    so that he's not moving straight towards her.
  - Who?
  - Both Whitman and Lily in the shot.
  - Lily turns and stares at Whitman.
  - Maybe half turn of her body, her hands frozen mid-action with whatever she was
    doing.
  - The man who haunts you.
  - Lily just stares at Whitman, frozen in fear, unable to move.
  - You can trust me, Madeline.
  - Very, very low key. As gently and quietly as possible. Very indirect. Not even
    quite looking straight at her, maybe faced slightly away and looking at Lily
    at a bit of an angle.
  - Very very still.
  - How do you know that name?
  - Cut to wide shot right as she crumples to ground.
  - Totally stunned. Wind knocked out of her. World turned upside down.
  - She sits down heavily on the edge of the raised platform in front of the sink.
  - She sits down hard, bump, then speaks.
  - Utter shock on Lily's face. She stares at Whitman for a moment, speechless.
  - Lily starts to crumple to the ground, but we cut to the next shot right as that's
    happening.
  - Just answer the question. Who is he? Who did this to you?
  - It's complicated. Why don't you just tell me who's responsible for all this?
  - Honestly, I'm not sure. But I do know that you don't deserve any of this and
    if you tell me who's responsible, I will make sure it never happens again.
  - It's Madeline, isn't it? Give me something to work with.
  - 
  - Whitman does something casual with his hands, like puts them in his pocket or
    puts them on his hips or takes out a notebook or something.
  - I can't help you if you don't talk to me, Madeline.
  - He's starting to get a bit fed up, honestly.
  - Whitman crosses his arms.
  - You can't stop him, Whitman.
  - Her attention snaps back onto Whitman. Extreme, red alert, hypervigilant focus.
  - Is it Parrish, your manager?
  - I see these next three shots as a bit of a verbal tennis match, back and forth,
    slightly combative. Hence the over-the-shoulder shots, which I hope will create
    a sense of the control of the conversation bouncing back and forth between the
    two characters.
  - Relentless. Can't let this go.
  - Rod?! He's just as much a slave here as I am. He's not even the real manager.
  - Lily scoffs at the mention of Rod Parrish's name.
  - Then who is?
  - 
  - As Lily stands, cut to her close up so we can really feel her indecision.
  - This is a point of no return for her. The hardest decision she has made in a
    long time.
  - Lily hesitates, then rises.
  - We're running out of time, Lily! I need a name.
  - Trying to push her.
  - Gesturing forcefully his with hands. This is urgent!
  - Lily -- Madeline -- please. Give me a name.
  - Nearing his wits' end. This is taking way too long.
  - Shaking his head when he gets her name wrong. Frustrated and flustered.
  - Madeline. I can't help you unless you talk to me. What is his name?
  - Open, pleading gestures.
  - I don't know his name. I've never even seen his face. But he comes by once a
    week. Monday nights, after the weekend rush. He sits in his car in the parking
    lot. Rod goes out to talk to him, give him the money, get orders, you know. Rod's
    not a bad guy, really. I think he tries to make things as easy for us as he can.
  - Since it's a long set of lines, it might be smart to cut back to Whitman briefly
    in the middle of them.
  - She looks away, thinking, weighing everything in her mind. These lines start
    off weak and hesitant and get stronger as she goes along.
  - She does not answer right away. Rest on Lily for a minute before she speaks.
  - What time on Monday?
  - Restrained eagerness. We're right on the brink of a breakthrough.
  - Nine p.m., I think.
  - Still looking away.
  - And this guy, your manager -- this is the one who took you?
  - You really have no idea what you're up against. He's nobody. Green Man has a
    hundred just like him.
  - Lily finally looks up at Whitman again. She's afraid -- but she's afraid for
    him.
  - I'm not even from China or Thailand or whatever it is they advertise. None of
    us are. The names, the accents, it's all fake. I'm from Modesto.
  - I think it's time for a straight on, wide open close up. We are seeing the really
    Lily, aka Madeline, for the first time.
  - 'Her gaze drifts away from Whitman after she speaks. She starts to remember.
    A thousand memories flooding back into her soul.

    

    The line is a little
    absent, distracted. There''s so much going on inside her right now that she''s
    not even really answering Whitman''s question.'
  - I see her arms wrapped around herself, kind of hugging herself tight, some very
    small comfort in this overwhelming moment.
  - Madeline --
  - Madeline --
  - My thinking here (for all three branches at this spot) is to keep Whitman in
    a medium shot so that when we immediately cut back to Lily as she interrupts
    him she has more power in the moment because she'll be in a close up.
  - Madeline --
  - Green Man?
  - Whitman frowns, confused. Did he mishear Lily?
  - 
  - A door slams somewhere in the hall.
  - Lily and Whitman both look toward the sound of the slamming door. Then Lily hurries
    out of the room to investigate. Whitman follows her to the door.
  - What is it?
  - Calling after Lily, although she does not answer right away.
  - Whitman can tell something is wrong, but he's not sure what.
  - Whitman waits uneasily for Lily to return.
  - Jasmine is gone.
  - 
  - 
  - She heard us. I have to go. I'll have the station send someone to keep an eye
    on you all.
  - As soon as the line is done, he starts for the door.
  - As soon as the line is done, he starts for the door.
  - 'Lily steps fully into the room and out of the way so Whitman can exit.

    

    He
    hurries for the door, but pauses in front of Lily.'
  - You're going to be free, Madeline.
  - A two shot of Whitman looking down at Lily.
  - Whitman pauses in the doorway, looking down at Lily for a second, then exits.
  - He hovers there for just a split second, delivers the line, and hurries out.
  - We hear Whitman's footsteps receding and then the same door opening and closing.
  - Lily watches him go, still trying to process everything that just happened.
  - Video returns to normal.
  - Sound returns to normal.
  - 'Whitman shakes it off, tries to gather his thoughts. '
  - Lily reappears in the doorway, looking worried.
  - It's Whitman, isn't it?
  - Yes, Ma'am.
  - Still a patrol officer, I see.
  - Senior Patrol Officer.
  - Yes, Ma'am.
  - Not for much longer, Ma'am.
  - And how old are you?
  - Thirty-seven.
  - Not everybody's cut out to be a cop, Whitman. No shame in doing something else.
  - Understood, Ma'am.
  - It's crossed my mind.
  - With all due respect, Ma'am, I don't want to do something else.
  - Stubborn AND can't follow orders. Great. Sounds like me.
  - You'll never make Sergeant with that attitude, Whitman.
  - Do you know why they put me in here?
  - Before my time, Ma'am.
  - 'Now you''re making ME feel old.

    

    I do what no one else wants to
    do: human trafficking cases. It''s long, slow, thankless work, but I''m pathologically
    incapable of making life easy for myself. So I here I sit, building RICO cases
    under fluorescent lights.

    

    Pull up a chair. I''ll show you how these
    computer programs help us catch dirtbags.'
